Accordingly, each applicant is advised that disclosure of his or her social security number (SSN) is recommended as a condition for making application to any of the UH campuses, in view of the practical administrative difficulties which UH would encounter in maintaining adequate student records without the continued use of the SSN. The SSN will not be used as an iden - tifying number on University documents.  A unique, computer generated UH identification number will be assigned to the student upon application to any of the UH campuses. Although the SSN is no longer used as a student identification 2025-2026 UH WEST O’AHU GENERAL CATALOG 17 ENTERING THE UNIVERSITY number, it will be used to verify the identity of the applicant to reconcile against other official documents such as applications for financial aid, determination of residency for tuition purposes, regis - tration and academic record-keeping; tax information (e.g., 1098-T form); student affairs programs requiring verification of enrollment for the purpose of providing services (e.g., Veterans Affairs); and alumni affairs. Authority for requiring the disclosure of an applicant’s SSN is grounded in Section 304.2 and Section 304.4, Hawai‘i Revised Statutes as amended, which provides that the Board of Regents of the University of Hawai‘i  shall have general management and control of the affairs of the University. UH has, for several years, consistently required the disclosure of social security numbers on the System Ap - plication Form and other necessary University documents. In addition, it should be noted that the SSN of a parent or guardian of an applicant is also requested if the applicant claims residency on the basis of the residency of the parent, guardian, or spouse. A parent or guardian is advised that disclosure of his or her SSN for the above purpose is mandatory. Failure to provide it may affect the applicant’s admission to the University and the tuition charged to the applicant. Parent’s or guardian’s SSN will be recorded only on the UH System Application (Residency Declaration) itself and will not be main - tained in any other system records. Its use will be restricted to further verification of information reported on the System Application (Residency Declaration) by the applicant and/or parent or guardian. Student Identification Number UH West O‘ahu uses a computer generated number for student identification numbers. U.S. citizens should indicate their SSN on their application. International students do not need to have a SSN; they will be assigned an identification number by the Office of Admissions. For additional information about SSN disclosure, see Social Security Number. Student Ethnicity Data Students are urged to supply race/ethnic information on ap - plications and other forms when requested, since UH West O‘ahu must provide a number of federal, state, and educational agencies with this data each year. UH Email Upon acceptance, students should sign up for a UH username which is required to register for classes and access their records. This username followed by “ hawaii.edu ” (i.e., username@ hawaii.edu ) is a student’s official UH email address. Email is an official means of communication for University-re - lated business. The University will periodically send notices to students through email such as UH Alert Notification, informa - tion on University activities/events, reminders on deadlines and other notices of interest to students. Email notices will only be sent to “ hawaii.edu ” accounts. Students are responsible for reading their email on a regular basis. Students may retrieve their UH email directly at gmail.hawaii.edu . RESIDENCY FOR TUITION PURPOSES The University is required to determine the residency status of each applicant. Therefore, each applicant must complete and submit a residency declaration together with such documenta - tion considered necessary to clearly determine residency status. The burden of proof for establishing resident status lies with each applicant. Final decisions will be made by the University’s Residency Officer. Students classified as nonresidents are Rows of photovoltaic panels located on the souththern side of campus. The 500 kilowatt array provides various degrees of power to the entire campus. 18 2025-2026 UH WEST O’AHU GENERAL CATALOG ENTERING THE UNIVERSITY required to pay nonresident tuition. All nonresident students who are newly admitted to UH may be affected by UH’s policy regarding nonresident status for tuition purposes. The policy is in accordance with Chapter 20-4-8, Hawai‘i Administrative Rules which states: “Presence in Hawai‘i primarily to attend an institution of higher education shall not create resident status. A nonresident student shall be presumed to be in Hawai‘i primarily to attend an institution of higher learning. Continued presence in Hawai‘i during vacation periods and occasional periods of interruption of the course of study shall not in itself overcome this presumption. ” Nonresi - dent students who enter any UH campus may not be allowed to change his/her residency status from nonresident to resident during any period in which s/he: • is enrolled for six (6) or more credits at any institution of higher learning in Hawai‘i; • was absent from Hawai‘i for more than 30 days per year during school vacation periods; • received student financial aid assistance based on residency in another state; or • was a dependent of nonresident parent(s) or legal guardian. The maximum number of nonresident students that may be admitted by the University is limited by the Board of Regents Controlled Growth Policy of the UH System. Therefore, affected students are encouraged to apply early.  Students who do not qualify on the first day of instruction as bona fide residents of the state of Hawai‘i for tuition purposes must pay the nonresident tuition. An official determination of residency status is made at the time of application. Applicants may be required to provide documentation to verify residency status. Once classified as a nonresident, students continue to be clas - sified as a nonresident during their enrollment at UH West O‘ahu until they present satisfactory evidence to the Residency Officer that proves residency. Definition of Hawai‘i Residency A student is deemed a resident of the State of Hawai‘i for tuition purposes if the student (18 years old or older) or the student (under 18 years old) and the student’s parents or legal guardians have done the following: 1. Demonstrated intent to establish domicile in Hawai‘i (see below for indicia); 2. Been physically present in Hawai‘i for 12 consecutive months prior to the first day of instruction and subsequent to the demonstration of intent to establish domicile in Hawai‘i; and 3. The student, whether adult or minor, has not been claimed as a dependent for tax purposes for at least 12 consecu - tive months prior to the first day of instruction by his/her parents or legal guardians who are not residents of Hawai‘i. T o demonstrate the intent to make Hawai‘i a person’s domicile, the following indicia apply, but no single act is sufficient to establish residency for tuition purposes: Filing Hawai‘i resident personal income tax return; Voting/registering to vote in the state of Hawai‘i; and other indicia, such as permanent employ - ment and ownership or continuous leasing of a dwelling in Hawai‘i. Additional Determining Factors Other legal factors involved in making a residency determina - tion include the following: 1. The age of majority is 18 years. Therefore, the applicant",

The 12 months of continuous residence in Hawai‘i shall begin on the date upon which the first overt action (see indicia above) is taken to make Hawai‘i one’s domicile. Resident status will be lost if it is interrupted during the 12 months immediately preceding the first day of instruction; 3. Residency in Hawai‘i and residency in another place cannot be held simultaneously; 4. Presence in Hawai‘i primarily to attend an institution of higher learning does not create resident status, regard - less of the length of stay. A student cannot establish residency by simply being enrolled in school. If a student is a nonresident, it is presumed that he or she is living in Hawai‘i primarily to attend school and his or her presence is temporary even if the student lives in Hawai‘i during vacation and other breaks from study. For example, the student may be presumed to live in Hawai‘i primarily to attend school if he or she is enrolled in school half-time or more, appears to be receiving significant financial support from family members who reside outside Hawai‘i, is absent from the state for more than 30 days per year during school vacation period, or receives student financial assistance based on residency in another state or jurisdiction; 5. The residency of unmarried students who are minors follows that of the parents or legal guardian. Marriage emancipates a minor; 6. Resident status, once acquired, will be lost by future voluntary action of the resident inconsistent with such status. However, Hawai‘i residency will not be lost solely because of absence from the state while a member of the U.S. Armed Forces, while engaged in navigation, or while a student at any institution of learning.",

This was called your “maximum eligibility period.” Your maximum eligibility period was generally based on the published length of your program at that time. Federal Direct Subsidized Loan:  A fixed interest loan awarded to undergraduates who demonstrate financial need. This loan is borrowed directly from the federal government. The federal government pays the interest on the loan until repayment begins and/or while recipients are in deferment. Interest rates and/or loan origination fees may vary each aid year. Federal Direct Unsubsidized Loan:  A loan typically awarded to undergraduates who do not demonstrate financial need, but may also be used to supplement a Direct Subsidized Loan. The federal government does not pay for the interest on this loan; recipients are responsible for the accrued interest from the time of disbursement until repayment in full. However, recipients have the option of capitalizing the loan until repayment begins, having it accrue interest while recipients are in school and having that accrued interest added to the principal loan amount. The terms for the Direct Unsubsidized Loan are the same as those for the Direct Subsidized Loan. Interest rates and/or loan origination fees may vary each aid year. Federal Direct PLUS Loan:  A federal loan for parents of dependent, undergraduate students enrolled at least half time (six credits). The interest rate on the PLUS loan may vary. Upon applying for the Direct PLUS, the parent will go through a credit verification process, so they must possess good credit histories. Parents may borrow up to the cost of attendance minus any other financial aid.  Repayment usually begins 60 days after the final loan disbursement for the academic year. Loan fees will be deducted proportionately from each loan disbursement.STUDENT EMPLOYMENT In addition to outside general employment postings, UH West O‘ahu offers two types of student employment opportunities: Federal Work-Study and On-Campus Employment. Federal Work-Study (FWS) Program:  This is a part-time employment opportunity available for students who qualify based on financial need as determined by the completion of the FAFSA.  The student must be in good academic standing, and enrolled at least half-time (6 credits). The primary area of FWS jobs are in community service (e.g., tutoring elementary school aged children, working in disability services, service learning coordinator). Hours worked are paid directly to the student on a bi-monthly basis. The benefit of FWS is that earnings are not calculated as income when applying for financial aid. View FWS job opportunities at the UH Student Employment and Coop - erative Education (SECE) website at www.hawaii.edu/sece . A FWS award does not guarantee a job.  The award is the maximum amount a student may earn in a FWS position for the award year. There are limited FWS jobs on and off campus with UH West O‘ahu. Students must apply and be hired for a FWS job in order to earn the FWS funds awarded. On-Campus Employment: Part-time employment (maximum 20 hours per week) at the University is available to students enrolled at least half-time (6 credits) and in good academic standing. Hours worked are paid directly to the student on a bi-monthly basis.

Courses which are only offered as CR/NC do not count towards this limit. • No more than 40 credit hours of CR may be counted toward a degree. Students should be aware that some universities, professional schools, employers, and scholarship/fellowship awarding agencies may not recognize this option or may recalculate the \"CR\" as a \"C\" grade and the \"NC\" as an \"F\" grade. Students intending to transfer to another institution or planning to attend graduate/professional schools should check with those institutions before selecting a CR/NC option. Incomplete Grades: With the approval of the instructor, an “I” or incomplete grade may be given at the request of the student. An “I” indicates that the student has not completed a small but important part of a semester’s work if the instructor believes that the incomplete was caused by conditions beyond the student’s control. A student who receives an “I” grade should promptly consult the instructor to determine what work must be done and the deadline to complete the work for changing the grade of “I” to a final grade. An instructor giving an “I” grade will also record the grade that will replace the “I” if the work is not completed by the deadline that was agreed upon by the student and instructor.  This grade is computed based on what grades or other evidence the instructor does have, averaged together with F’s and/or zeros for all incomplete work. If the work is completed and submitted by the deadline specified by the instructor, the in - structor will report the change of grade, taking the completed work into consideration.  If the work is not completed and submitted to the instructor by the deadline, the “I” grade will change to the grade that was assigned to the “I” grade (i.e., an “IF” will convert to a final grade of “F”) by the University deadline (see Academic Calendar).  Grade changes for incom - pletes must be submitted by the instructor to the Office of the Registrar no later than the date specified on the University’s academic calendar. Grade Point Averages:  Grade point averages (GPA) are de - termined by dividing the total number of grade points by the total number of credit hours for which a student has received letter grades (excluding CR, I, L, NC, R, RD, and W). • The UH West O‘ahu semester GPA is calculated on any one semester’s credits and grade points. • The UH West O‘ahu cumulative GPA is calculated on all such work taken at the University. CHANGE OF GRADES A student who believes an error has been made in the assign - ment of a grade must initiate contact with the instructor or division chair within 10 calendar days of final grades being posted for that term.  Any appeal made after this time-period may not be reviewed. ACADEMIC STATUS Satisfactory Academic Progress: T o demonstrate satisfac - tory academic progress, students are expected to maintain at least a 2.0 UH West O‘ahu cumulative GPA. Satisfactory academic progress is required for continued enrollment, as well as to maintain eligibility for financial aid and veterans’ benefits. Dean’s List: Students who perform at a high academic level will be placed on the Dean’s List for work completed at UH West O‘ahu by the end of each semester. T o qualify, students must enroll in a minimum of nine UH West O‘ahu credits during the semester. All classes must be completed at the end of the fall and spring term with a semester GPA of 3.75 or higher. Academic Warning:  A student whose UH West O‘ahu semester GPA is less than 2.0, but UH West O‘ahu cumula - tive GPA is at least a 2.0, will be considered to be on academic warning status.  Although not on academic probation, students are highly encouraged to meet with a College Success Advisor who can assist with academic planning. Academic Probation, Suspension, and Dismissal: Students who fail to meet the minimum scholastic require - ments of the University will be placed on academic probation or be suspended or dismissed. For purposes of measuring this minimum requirement, the GPA is used. Regulations governing academic probation, suspension, and dismissal are applied at the end of the fall and spring semesters. Probation: A student will be placed on academic probation at the end of any semester in which their UH West O‘ahu cumulative GPA falls below a 2.0. A student will remain on academic probation until their cumulative GPA rises to 2.0 or higher on a 4.0 scale. A student on academic probation will be considered to be progressing satisfactorily if, at the end of each successive semester, his/her current GPA for that semester is 2.0 or higher. 2025-2026 UH WEST O’AHU GENERAL CATALOG 47 ACADEMIC RECORDS Students who are placed on academic probation will be required to see a College Success Advisor for advising and to register for classes.

Final credits may be taken from an appropriately accredited institution and transferred back to UH West O‘ahu. Approval must be granted by the University Registrar prior to course work taken in absentia and the requirements must be met within a specified time frame.

UH West O‘ahu has affirmed the types of behavior that conflicts with the community standards that UH West O‘ahu values and expects of all students.  UH West O‘ahu expects students to maintain standards of personal integrity that are in harmony with the educational goals of our institution; to respect the rights, privileges, and property of others; and to observe national, state, and local laws and our institutional policies and processes. The Student Code of Conduct also delineates the appropri - ate hearing procedures, and describes the various sanctions that may be imposed. If the student is found Responsible for a violation, sanctions will range from a warning, restitution, to probation, suspension, expulsion, or the rescission of grades or degree. The Student Code of Conduct is available online at https://westoahu.hawaii.edu/studentconduct/  or through the Student Conduct Office (Campus Center, C240, Student Services, 2nd Floor) or the Office of the Vice Chancellor for Student Affairs. ACADEMIC INTEGRITY The University is an academic community with high professional standards. Its teaching, research and service purposes are seriously disrupted and subverted by academic dishonesty. Such dishonesty, which includes cheating and plagiarism, are examples of potential viola - tions of the Student Code of Conduct.  If the student is found responsible for academic dishonesty, sanctions are imposed and can range from a written warning up to and including expulsion from UH West O‘ahu.Cheating:  Cheating includes, but is not limited to, (1) use of any unauthorized assistance in taking quizzes, tests, or examinations; (2) use of sources beyond those authorized by the instructor in writing papers, preparing reports, solving problems, or carrying out other assign - ments; (3) the acquisition, without permission, of tests or other academic material belonging to a member of the UH faculty, staff or student; and (4) engaging in any behavior specifically prohibited by a faculty member in the course syllabus or class discussion. Plagiarism: Plagiarism includes, but is not limited to, the use, by paraphrase or direct quotation, of the published or unpublished work of another person without full and clear acknowledgement. It also includes the unacknowl - edged use of materials prepared by another person or agency engaged in the selling of term papers or other academic materials. ACADEMIC GRIEVANCE Issues associated with the authority and responsibilities of faculty members may occasionally arise. T o protect the rights of students and faculty, the University has established an academic grievance procedure whereby students who believe that a faculty member has behaved in an improper manner may seek recourse. A reasonable attempt (by phone, mail, email or in person) should first be made to resolve the complaint of academic impro - priety on an informal basis with the faculty member. If the faculty member fails to respond to the student’s attempt to contact him/her within a ten-day period, or if a satisfactory resolution is not reached at this level, the matter should be reported, in writing, to the faculty member’s Division Chair. The Division Chair shall render Campus Policies VIEW OTHER POLICIES ON THE UH WEST O‘ AHU WEBSITE westoahu.hawaii.edu/campuspolicies/ 2025-2026 UH WEST O’AHU GENERAL CATALOG 51 CAMPUS POLICIES a decision/recommendation for resolution within ten working days upon receipt of the report of academic impropriety by the student. Should a student decide to appeal the Division Chair’s decision and/or recommen - dation, the student has the right to file a formal academic grievance with the Chair of the Academic Grievance Committee. For specific information, the academic grievance procedure is available at https://westoahu. hawaii.edu/policies/academic-grievance-procedure/ , or may be requested from the Office of the Vice Chancellor for Student Affairs. CLASS ATTENDANCE Regular and prompt class attendance is expected of all students. A student is expected to inform each instructor of anticipated or unavoidable absences. The responsibility for make-up work lies with the student. Check with the instructor regarding the impact of missed classes on your grade. When a student fails to attend a class, or stops attending class but does not officially withdraw from that class, the instructor may assign any letter grade, including an “F. ” Under no circumstances will a “W” be awarded by the instructor. CREDIT HOUR POLICY One credit hour represents the amount of work that is expected of a student to achieve intended learning outcomes. In a traditional face-to-face course, that approximates not less than one hour of direct faculty instruction and a minimum two hours of student work outside of class per week through (approximately) one 15 week semester. The clock-hour requirements apply uniformly to courses of varying credits, duration, modes of delivery, and types of academic activity. The credit hour definition requires that: • For courses with non-traditional, non-standard seat times (e.g. directed reading and research, senior capstone, laboratory, practicum, service learning, internship, study abroad) and courses with alternate modes of delivery (e.g. online, hybrid, HITS), that one credit hour represents an equivalent amount of work in the achievement of intended learning outcomes. • For courses scheduled in a shortened format (e.g. weekends, fewer than 15 weeks), that the hours are prorated so that the classes have the same total number of hours as if they were scheduled for a full 15 week semester and that one credit hour represents an equivalent amount of work in the achievement of intended learning outcomes. • Regardless of types of activity, delivery mode, or duration, courses with equivalent Division course numbers and titles will be consistent in learning outcomes, purpose, scope, and quality. • A semester credit hour will be consistent throughout all courses and academic programs. • The course credit hour will be awarded only to students whose work demonstrates that they have sat - isfactorily achieved the intended learning outcomes. FAMILY EDUCATIONAL RIGHTS AND PRIVACY ACT (FERPA) The Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act (FERPA) affords eligible students certain rights with respect to their education records. These rights include: • The right to inspect and review the student’s education records within 45 days after the day the University of Hawaiʻi–West Oʻahu receives a request for access. A student should submit to the registrar, dean, head of the academic department, or other appropriate official, a written request that identi - fies the record(s) the student wishes to inspect. The school official will make arrangements for access and notify the student of the time and place where the records may be inspected. If the records are not maintained by the school official to whom the request was submitted, that official shall advise the student of the correct official to whom the request should be addressed. • The right to request the amendment of the student’s education records that the student believes is inac - curate, misleading, or otherwise in violation of the student’s privacy rights under FERPA.  A student who wishes to ask the school to amend a record should write the school official responsible for the record, clearly identify the part of the record the student wants changed, and specify why it should be changed. If the school decides not to amend the record as requested, the school will notify the student in writing of the decision and the student’s right to a hearing regarding the request for amendment. Addi - tional information regarding the hearing procedures will be provided to the student when notified of the right to a hearing. • The right to provide written consent before the school discloses personally identifiable information (PII) from the student’s education records, except to the extent that FERPA authorizes disclosure without consent. 2025-2026 UH WEST O’AHU GENERAL CATALOG 52 CAMPUS POLICIES The school discloses education records without a student’s prior written consent under the FERPA exception for disclosure to school officials with legiti - mate educational interests. A school official is a person employed by the University of Hawaiʻi–West Oʻahu in an administrative, supervisory, academic, research, or support staff position (including law enforcement unit personnel and health staff); a person serving on the board of regents; or a student serving on an official committee, such as a disciplinary or grievance committee. A school official also may include a volunteer or contractor outside of the University of Hawaiʻi–West Oʻahu who performs an institutional service or function  for which the school would otherwise use its own employees and who is under the direct control of the school with respect to the use and maintenance of PII from education records, such as an attorney, auditor, or collection agent. A school official has a legitimate educational interest if the official needs to review an education record in order to fulfill his or her professional responsibilities for the University of Hawaiʻi–West Oʻahu. • Parents and spouses of students are advised that informa - tion contained in education records, with the exception of directory information, will not be disclosed to them without the prior written consent of the student.• Students are advised that institutional policy and pro - cedures required under FERPA have been published as Administrative Procedure AP 7.022, Procedures Relating to Protection of the Educational Rights and Privacy of Students.  Copies of Administrative Procedure AP 7.022 may be obtained from the Office of the Vice Chancellor for Students. • The right to file a complaint with the U.S. Depart - ment of Education concerning alleged failures by the University of Hawaiʻi–West Oʻahu to comply with the requirements of FERPA.

The student must take eight courses from their freshman through their senior years that are designed to provide the student with multi-cultural and multi-disciplinary viewpoints. However, the student concentrates in Hawaiian-Pacific Studies, History, English, Mathematics, or Philosophy – focusing most of their course work in one of these concentrations. In their final year, the students do a senior project or senior practicum in the field of their concentration.  Students must complete three upper division Writing-Intensive courses which includes the senior project or practicum course.  The Division also recommends that students complete two semesters of Hawaiian or a second language. HUMANITIES DIVISION MISSION STATEMENT The Humanities Division teaches students to analyze the human condition and apply their knowledge pertaining to diversity, equity, and inclusion. Through a foundation in the liberal arts, a Humanities degree prepares teacher-scholars with linguistic and critical skills to analyze society and culture within global and local contexts. Our students study academic and media based resources through the lens of various knowledges, especially those of Native Hawaiian and other Indigenous peoples. HUMANITIES DIVISION VISION STATEMENT The Humanities Division is committed to fostering creative and innovative learners often rooted in place-based learning and Indigenous ways of knowing.

The student has a practicum site supervisor, in addition to a Faculty Advisor in their concentration.  The Senior Project is typically a research paper done on a topic of interest to the student.  Alternatively, it may be a creative writing project, or it could be a curriculum prepared for a school course.  It can also be in alternative formats, such as video or combined media.  These details are coordinated with the student’s senior project Faculty Advisor.HUMANITIES CONCENTRATIONS ENGLISH (ENG) The Humanities concentration in English offers students the opportunity to critically and creatively examine literature; artistic expression; cultural, social, and rhetorical analyses; and a wide array of reading and writing practices. Students begin their studies with survey courses that introduce UH West Oʻahu’s four emphasis fields: literary studies, creative writing, rhetoric and composition, and cultural studies. After exploring a range of disciplinary approaches, upper-level students then move on to develop disciplinary depth in emphasis field(s) of their choice, selecting from a range of coursework influenced by cultural and rhetorical theory; drama and film studies; media theory; language and composition studies; literary criticism; and writing workshops. Finally, students apply this knowledge in culminat - ing senior seminars or practica that engage the English studies emphases of their choice from original, critical, and transdisci - plinary perspectives. For students with a concentration in English, 48 credits are required. *Note:  Courses may be used only once to fulfill a lower or upper division English requirement, emphasis track, or field requirement, or elective towards graduation. 1. 18 credits of required lower division course work: • ENG 240   Intro to Literary Studies • ENG 272 Intro to Lit: Cultural Studies • ENG 273 Intro to Lit: Creative Writing & Literature • ENG 274 Intro to Rhetoric & Composition",

In completing courses drawn from a variety of disciplines--among them histori - cal scholarship, literary studies, music scholarship, and philoso - phy—students develop critical thinking skills and learn to argue for interpretation of texts that powerfully shape our world. FMPC students co mplete a course in the Media History and Theory area as well as one course in each of the following clusters: Film and T elevision, Popular Music/Theater, and Journalism/Media Analysis. These clusters include courses such as “Japan Cool: Anime, Manga, and Film,” “Fairy T ales and their Adaptations,” “Cool Runnings: A History of Reggae,” and “TV and American Culture. ” Students then select one of these clusters as a “primary field” and complete three additional courses in this area along with an elective course drawn from a list that includes “Japanese Culture” and “Hawaiian Mythology. ” Students are also given the opportunity to explore the arts through coursework in creative media, creative writing, or music practice. The humanities FMPC concentration provides a foundation for many career paths, including journalism or further study at the graduate level. For students with a concentration in FMPC, 33 credits are required. *Note: Courses may be used only once to fulfill a lower or upper division FMPC requirement, primary track, or elective towards graduation. 1. Students with a concentration in FMPC are required to take one Culture History/Theory course (3 credits): • ENG 300C Intro to Cultural Theory; or",

At the foundation of the Hawaiian-Pacific Studies program is the perspective and understanding that a single ocean connects the islands and the peoples of the Pacific and Hawai‘i.  The curriculum is designed to provide a good foundation of knowledge that includes art, history, languages, literatures, and contemporary issues of all Oceania (including Australia, Melanesia, Micronesia, and Polynesia), with Hawai‘i as a core of this knowledge.  We strive to incorporate the idea that each of the societies of the Pacific has their own unique history, language, social and cultural practices, literature, arts, architecture, and contemporary issues, as well as the idea that all of Oceania is linked by connections and continuities that precede any modern constructs of nation - ality and cultural areas. The program offers a wide array of courses on Hawai‘i and the Pacific Islands, enabling the student to gain a broad overview of the Pacific, as well as in-depth knowledge of specific aspects of Hawai‘i and the Pacific.  Students who complete the concentra - tion will have an excellent foundation for careers in the public or private sector that include teaching, counseling, health administration, cultural resource management, environmen - tal resource management, urban planning, land management, as well as film and media.  The concentration also prepares students for graduate school programs in a variety of disci - plines such as anthropology, archaeology, education, English, geography, history, folklore, art history, religion, political science, Hawaiian language, Hawaiian studies, and Pacific Islands studies. For students with a concentration in Hawaiian-Pacific Studies , 49 credits are required including: 1.  3-9 credits in Introductory courses including two required courses: (these may be used to fulfill General Education and Humanities Core Requirements.

The certificate will also function as a pathway for the dissemination of traditional healing knowledge and skill that will serve as a model for other indigenous groups. T raining will consist of theoretical courses that focus on epi - demiology and health disparities and practical courses in the Native Hawaiian traditional healing practices (ho’oponopno or conflict resolution, lomi lomi or massage, and lāʻau lapaʻau or herbal medicines). An overarching goal is to work towards eliminating health disparities in Native Hawaiian, Pacific Islander and other underserved communities by creating a collaboration between T raditional and Western Medicine. As a student-centered con - centration, the Certificate in Hawaiian and Indigenous Health and Healing seeks to promote the integration of underserved and underrepresented students into an academic and cultural milieu that supports educational achievement and economic success. • HIHH1: Identify, analyze, document and write about local and global issues affecting Native Hawaiian and Indigenous health and healing within physical, mental, social, and spiritual domains. • HIHH2:  Demonstrate knowledge of and communicate orally aspects of Native Hawaiian and Indigenous health and healing values, methods, and practice. • HIHH3:  Conduct research involving Naive Hawaiian and Indigenous Health and Healing issues utilizing cultural research methodologies. • HIHH4:  Provide solutions to Native Hawaiian and Indigenous healthcare disparities, and ethical and cultural dilemmas through policies, principles, & practices within the fields of social work, public health, and healthcare. • HIHH5:  Identify and apply Native Hawaiian and Indig - enous frameworks, models, values and protocols within health and healing practices.

Complementary area: Nine upper division credits in a second Social Sciences concentration area: ANTH, ECON, POLS, PSY, SOC, or SCFS (Sustainable Community Food Systems).SOCIAL SCIENCES CONCENTRATIONS ANTHROPOLOGY (ANTH) Anthropology is divided into subfields for examining human diversity across time and space.  As a holistic discipline, an - thropology produces an encompassing picture of human life through examination of the interplay between human genetic variation and the environment, ancient and historical societies, as well as conditions in today’s globalized world. T o understand everyday life, anthropologists situate it within broader histori - cal, political, physical, economic, social and cultural contexts. Our program has an applied focus, emphasizing workforce development. Applied anthropology uses the discipline’s widely recognized cross-cultural knowledge and methods to identify and apply solutions to real life problems. With an anthropol - ogy degree, students can put their knowledge into practice, both in and outside of the classroom, by identifying different employment opportunities such as jobs in contract archaeology, forensics, museum curation, business, development, environ - mental projects, education, law, health, the non-profit sector, the federal government, and consulting.  Our concentration not only prepares students for graduate school, it provides students with a widely recognized anthropological skillset, while fa - cilitating relationships with community groups and potential employers through service learning and internship opportuni - ties.

Political science at UH West O‘ahu puts government and policy analysis in the larger context of the search for the best way to live the Socratic quest for the “Good Life” . Any particular way of life is studied in its totality: what it is, what it was, and what it could and should be. A political approach to any issue generally begins with an awareness of this larger context and how the most pressing problems of the age impact the perspective of the searching individual. The struggle for improvement then draws from a multi-civilizational, cross-cultural, comparative history of the human condition. This ranges from the baseline of the nine-tenths of human existence we spent as hunter-gatherers, to the various models of the industrial nation state and the emerging global electronic community. The method of political science is distinctive in its emphasis on synthesis making connections and seeing relationships. Par - ticular attention is paid to making the connection between the bigger picture of political reality and the life-experience of the student. The goal is to help students formulate their own vision of where society should be going, and then to motivate and equip them for responsible participation in public life. T eaching strategies emphasize active, democratic and multi-cultural modes of learning.  Political science thus offers an excellent general education, relevant to careers in local and national government, international agencies, journalism, law, public administration, social work, business, and teaching. For students with a concentration in Political Science, 45 credits are required, including the following courses: 1. ENG 200 Composition II 2. MATH 103  College Algebra; or",

They often work with other forensic scien - tists and homicide investigators to identify a decedent, discover evidence of foul play, and/or the time since death. They estimate the age, sex, ancestry, stature, and unique features of a decedent from skeletal, badly decomposed, or otherwise un - identifiable human remains. Forensic anthropologists are often in charge of the recovery of human remains, responsible for the site recording (photography, mapmaking, etc.), and serve as expert court witnesses. This work is important for both legal and humanitarian reasons. The certificate in Applied Forensic Anthropology (AFAN) will give students a solid foundation in forensic anthropology and a good introduction to the wider field of forensic science. Particular emphasis will be given to community and justice focused aspects of forensic anthropology.  This certificate may be earned alone or in conjunction with a Bachelor’s degree. Degrees that are especially relevant are a Bachelor of Arts in the Social Sciences with a concentration in Anthropology or a Bachelor of Arts in Public Administration with a concentra - tion in Justice Administration.  When combined with relevant degrees, the certificate in AFAN will make students more competitive for a variety of job opportunities and advanced education in forensic anthropology, the wider field of forensic science, and other related fields. The UHWO Anthropology program focuses on \"Applied An - thropology\", which is the application of anthropological data, perspectives, theory, and methods to identify, assess, and solve social problems. The Certificate in Applied Forensic Anthro - pology is a specific subset of applied anthropology, providing students with a STEM academic background and skills (voca - tional) training for jobs such as criminalists, crime scene techni - cians, crime scene investigators, evidence technicians, crime scene analysts, detectives, forensic anthropologists, archaeolo - gists, and museum curators. The CAFA has a required capstone practicum course, in which students have a culminating experi - ence at a relevant agency such as the Defense POW/MIA Ac - counting Agency (DPAA), Medical Examiner's Office, Bishop Museum, Honolulu Police Department (HPD), State Historic Preservation Division (SHPD), etc. Students gain hands-on experience with archaeological field and human skeletal biology methods, which require skills in critical thinking, cultural awareness, writing, and oral communication. They also must be detailed oriented and methodological on how they approach potential problems. Former students work at the DPAA, Bishop Museum, HPD Sci - entific Investigations Unit, private archaeology firms, and SHPD, which were direct or indirect results of the experiential learning and internships that they received from completing the AFAN. This program is a collaboration between Leeward Community College and the UH West O‘ahu.  A total of 29-30 credits are required. Students are welcomed and encouraged to enroll concurrently in classes at both campuses. For information on admission, please contact the Office of Admissions at (808) 689-2900.",

The study of research design, data analysis, statistics and theory in the context of health helps strengthen the critical thinking skills vital for complex decision-making in health. The acquisition of these skills place students in a competitive position in a labor market that requires not only the mastery of specific skill sets, but also the flexibility to respond to changing jobs and job re - quirements. The certificate enhances a student's primary degree by preparing them for graduate-level social science research on health and medicine related topics as well as students inter - ested in applying for medical school with their MCAT exam or pursue careers in public health, nursing, health policy, health related non-profit organizations, substance abuse/mental health and allied health care services in Hawaiʻi or the wider Pacific. This 18-credit certificate is delivered through distance learning. The certificate can only be declared by Sophomore or higher-level standing students admitted to the program with a B GPA average. Students in the program need to maintain a B GPA in all approved certificate health and medicine-related courses. Nine (9) credits (six (6) outside the student’s concentra - tion/program) focus on social science health related research intended to provide students with basic training on research design and the range of quantitative and qualitative data collec - tion and data management techniques and skills (i.e., the use of SSPS and NVivo). The other nine (9) credits (six (6) outside the student’s con - centration/program) are designed to provide basic knowledge on social science health related theory aimed at understand - ing the sociocultural factors that contribute to population health inequalities, including social class, race/ethnicity, gender, sexuality, disability, immigration status, economics, and politics, and the social and cultural influences that shape medical authority, knowledge, and patient experiences with illness and treatment. SSHM1:   Students will demonstrate knowledge of specific social science in health research methods and related theories to the understanding of the sociocultural forces underlying health and illness experiences. SSHM2: Students will demonstrate fluency in methodologi - cal abilities, acquire information retrieval techniques, and other research-related competencies necessary for graduate-level social science research on health and medicine related topics and careers in medicine, public health, nursing, work in health related non-profit or - ganizations, substance abuse/mental health and allied health care services.

Although not required for certification, students are strongly encouraged to concurrently complete the Bachelor of Arts degree in Social Sciences with a concentration in Psychology. Students will receive a strong theoretical foundation in substance use disorders and exposure to the knowledge, skills, and attitudes identified by the federal Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA) as the basis for effective treatment of substance-related problems. Completion of the certificate satisfies current state education requirements for substance abuse counselors (note: the State education requirements may also be satisfied with other social science course work). State certification further requires fieldwork hours and a written and oral examination. For more information on the State certification call (808) 692-7518 or visit their website at: health.hawaii.gov/substance-abuse/ counselor -certification/. Students who apply to the SAAS program must meet the same admission requirements established for classified students. Program Prerequisites: Those planning to complete the cer - tificate should have taken an expository writing course (ENG 100 or equivalent), and an introductory Psychology course (PSY 100 or equivalent). In addition, a course in Abnormal Psychology should be completed within the last five years with a grade of “C” or better. This requirement may be satisfied by taking PSY 371 Abnormal Psychology at UH West O‘ahu. SAAS1: Apply the theory of Causation and Prevention as well as Biological and Social Correlates of Substance Abuse and Addiction to real world situations. SAAS2:  Critically evaluate current definitions of substance- related problems and major models of causation and treatment. SAAS3: Critically evaluate the practical skills needed to treat addiction. For students completing the certificate in Substance Abuse and Addictions Studies, 19 credits are required, including: • PSY 371  Abnormal Psychology (C or better grade) • PSY 373   Counseling Skills • PSY 374   Ethics in Counseling & Psychotherapy (1) (continued on next page) 2025-2026 UH WEST O’AHU GENERAL CATALOG 143 DIVISION OF SOCIAL SCIENCES • PSY 403   Causation and Prevention of Substance Abuse and Addiction • PSY 404   Social Correlates of Psychoactive Drug Use or PSY 408 Group Interventions in Substance Abuse and Addiction • PSY 405   Biological Correlates of Psychoactive Drug Use • PSY 406   Assessment and Treatment of Substance Abuse and Addiction Up to two required courses may be waived if appropriate lower division courses (e.g., HSERV courses taken at Leeward Community College) were completed.

The Hawaiʻi State Legislature, in recognition of “substantial contributions of organized labor to the improvement of the social, political, and economic well- being of our citizenry” enacted Act 202 establishing the Center for Labor Education and Research and charged it with the following responsibilities: 1) T o provide labor education instruction, labor-related research and educational services for workers and their organizations; 2) T o provide labor education to the public; 3) T o advise and assist in the development of labor education programs, courses, activities for use within the DOE, including teacher preparation; 4) T o advise and assist in the implementation of labor studies degree programs in the University of Hawai‘i system; 5) T o be a clearinghouse for labor education matters in the State. As a center under Academic Affairs, UH West O‘ahu, CLEAR is designed to provide labor education, research and labor-related programs to workers, their organizations, university students, and the general public through a variety of methods including classroom instruction, seminars, workshops, publications and the use of the public media.Center for Labor Education & Research CLEARCLEARCLEARCenter for Labor Education & Research        Center for Labor Education & Research CLEARCLEARCLEARCenter for Labor Education & Research        Center for Labor Education & Research 2025-2026 UH WEST O’AHU GENERAL CATALOG 167 CENTER FOR LABOR EDUCATION & RESEARCH Located in the UH West O‘ahu James & Abigail Campbell Library, CLEAR maintains a research collection and archive of labor history and law, a labor research web site and publishes a variety of books and handbooks, including a guide to Hawai‘i Labor History, in addition to producing the televised documen - taries in its Rice & Roses series. The Center’s non-credit programs feature classes on Labor History, Workers’ Compensation, Grievance Handling, Labor Law, Collective Bargaining, Preventing Employment Discrimi - nation, Conflict Resolution, Parliamentary Procedure, and Leadership Skills. Like its research projects, the Center’s seminars and educa - tional programs are all designed to be of practical application to workers, their organizations and policy-makers. A recipient of the 2016 John Sessions Memorial Award, the labor history archive contains a clipping file on local unions in Hawai‘i, as well as an ever-growing collection of contracts, union newsletters, books, pamphlets and artifacts that record and preserve Hawai‘i’s rich labor history from plantation days to the present. Among the most highly prized components of this special collection are: The Isami Enomoto Labor History Murals, John Reineckeʻs research files, the late Professor Emeritus Ed. Beechert’s Hawai‘i sugar plantation files, The Honolulu Record, the old “day-books” of the Hawai‘i Carpenters’  Union, video - tapes and transcripts of interviews, documents and photographs of over 90 informants involved in the Great Hawai‘i Sugar Strike",

Access to the Center’s video library and special collections is by appointment only and must be arranged in advance. The research library contains the basic BNA loose-leaf services as well as many supplemental materials. CLEAR LEARNING OUTCOMES The Labor Studies faculty at the Center for Labor Education and Research assist UH West O‘ahu students to: • CLO 1 - Explain the role of labor in society. • CLO 2 - Demonstrate critical thinking, reflection and con - structive action on the importance of social, political, and economic issues as they relate to the workplace. • CLO 3 - Use insights drawn from literature, history, and philosophy in order to reflect critically on issues of work and society. • CLO 4 - Demonstrate knowledge of various aspects of labor law, including collective bargaining worker and indi - vidual rights. • CLO 5- Explain labor and workplace issues in a global context. • CLO 6 - Use the communication skills (such as negotiation and mediation) necessary to intervene wisely in shaping their environment. • CLO 7 - Demonstrate the ethics, knowledge, skills, and attitudes necessary for working in labor relations. The Center for Labor Education and Research offers credit courses in Labor Studies in anticipation of the development of a formalized Labor Studies program at UH West O‘ahu. Currently, there are approximate 30 Labor Studies degree programs offered in colleges and universities across the United States. Labor Studies programs include labor history, collective bargaining, labor contract administration and other courses that seek to prepare professionals for labor relations experi - ences and careers in union and non-union environments. Our courses equip students to think critically about the relationship between our work and quality of life. Labor studies courses provide students with the opportunity to view race, culture, gender, economics, political science, anthropology, history, and the future of work from a labor lens. Labor Studies not only prepares students for graduate school in law or social sciences field, it provides students with skillsets in understanding the details of the broader global economy as it impacts working people. According to industry sector estimates, there is a need for courses in labor relations in Hawai‘i. There are 65 local unions and union offices in the State of Hawai‘i alone with many of them having agents in Guam and Saipan. Typically, union administrative offices are staffed by agents or representatives employed to organize, negotiate, provide social services for members, research, provide media support, and organize and administer collective bargaining agreements. Labor Studies as an applied focus will equip graduates for work in labor relations as business agents, stewards, or social services providers in both private and public sector unions, in addition to research writing, labor-related governmental agencies, labor-related community organizations and politics. Labor Studies is an interdisciplinary academic field including labor history, economics, leadership skills, research writing and worker advocacy. 2025-2026 UH WEST O’AHU GENERAL CATALOG 168 CERTIFICATE IN LABOR STUDIES (LBST)",

Here in the Islands, Hawaiian ways of knowing and being are thus vital to the health and healing of the original peoples of Hawai‘i-nui-ākea. This course aims to expose students to three Hawaiian healing practices: hoʻoponopono (healing through ritualized communi - cation through self and ʻohana), lāʻau lapaʻau (healing through ritualized use of native plants and intention), and lomilomi (healing through ritualized touch and intention) . In this way new understandings can help families practice ancient ways connected to place, people, story and ancestral values hidden and unused in modern Hawaiʻi. The trilogy of Hawaiian healing practices will be contextualized within kaulana mahina, moon understanding, found within context. This course may be taken for CR/NC.",

FERP A Annual N otic e Addendum: As of J anuary 3, 2012, t he U .S.

First, the U .S. Co mptroller General, the U .S. A ttorney General, the U .S. S ecretary of Ed ucation, or state and lo cal education authorities (“F ederal and S tate Authorities”) m ay allow ac cess to you r records and P II without you r consent to an y third party desig nated by a Federal or State Authority to evaluate a fe deral- or state-supported education program. The e valuation may relate to an y program t hat is “ principally engaged in the p rovision of e ducation” such a s ear ly ch ildhood education and j ob training, as well as any program t hat is adm inistered by an e ducation agency or institution. Second, Federal and S tate Authorities m ay allow ac cess to you r education records and P II without you r consent to resear chers performing certain types of s tudies, i n certain cases e ven when we object to or do not r equest such r esear ch. Federal and S tate Authorities m ust obtain certain use-restriction and d ata security promises fr om the entities that they authorize t o receive you r PII, bu t the A uthorities ne ed not m aintain direct control over such e ntities. In add ition, in connection with Statewide L ongitudinal Data Systems, State Authorities m ay collect, c ompile, p ermanently retain, and sh are without you r consent PII from you r education records, and t hey may track you r participation in education and ot her programs by linking such P II to other personal information ab out you t hat they obtain from ot her Federal or State data sou rces, including workforce de velopment, unemployment insurance, ch ild w elfare, juvenile justice, m ilitary service, and m igrant student records systems. Use of S ocial S ecurit y Numb er The U niversity of H awai‘i (University) is c ommitted to safe guarding the p rivacy of p ersonal and c onfidential information of it s students, employees, alumni, and ot her individuals associated with the U niversity. In the no rmal practice of c onducting officia l University bu siness, the U niversity collects and m aintains confidential information relating to its students, including a s tudent’s Social Security Number (SSN). The U niversity requests that a student provide a S SN at the time of a pplication to the U niversity. The S SN is not r equired for enrollment; however, the U niversity is r equired by federal law to report to the Internal Revenue S ervice (IRS) the S SN and ot her information for tuition-paying students. Federal law also r equires the University to obtain and r eport to the IRS the S SN fo r any person to whom compensation is p aid. Due t o the p ractical adm inistrative difficu lties w hich the U niversity would encounter in maintaining ade quate student records and p rocessing financia l transactions without the S SN, the U niversity will continue to collect SSNs as permitted by law fo r officia l use w ithin the U niversity system. Providing the U niversity with you r SSN ensures that University programs and se rvices ar e available with the lea st del ay. Students will be assigned a U niversity generated student ide ntification number upon enrollment, which w ill be used as the p rimary ide ntifier. The S SN will not b e used as the p rimary ide ntifier of s tudents associated with the U niversity. The S SN w ill be used in act ivities, i ncluding bu t not l imited to, matching and r econciling do cuments in order to det ermine el igibility for adm ission and fi nancia l aid, to det ermine reside ncy for tuition pu rposes, t o comply w ith federal and/o r state law reporting requirements (e.g. for financia l aid, Internal Revenue S ervice mandates, T axpayer’s Relief A ct of 1997, Immigration and N aturalization Service), and i n ac cordance with the F amily Ed ucational Rig hts and P rivacy Act. The S SN w ill not b e disclose d to an y persons outside t he U niversity system, ex cept as allowed by law or with permission from the individual. This policy do es not p reclude, if a p rimary mean s of ide ntification is u navailable, the U niversity from using the S SN as needed to conduct officia l University bu siness. 54 Windward Co mmunity Co llege 2024–2025 C atalog College P olicies Nondiscrimina tion and A ffirma tive Action The U niversity of H awai‘i is an e qual opportunity/affi rmative act ion institution.
